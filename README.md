# Petals Around the Rose - Python Edition

## Introduction

This game was created for the "Dudes of 708" Software Engineering Internship coding challenge, which can be found [here](challenge/Dudes-of-708.pdf). It satisfies Challenge #3.

## What is it?

Petals Around the Rose is a mathematical brain teaser puzzle. The objective of the game is figure out how the result of rolling 3 die are calculated.

When you figure out the secret behind the guess is calculated (without looking at the source code), you become a "Potentate of the Rose". Not only that, but you're qualified to join the [Fraternity of the Rose](http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-frat.htm). You also reserve the right to torture anyone with the game, either by rolling physical dice or playing this Python implentation of it.

## How to Play
Navigate to wherever you cloned/downloaded the repository and run in your command line: 

`python3 petals-around-python.py`.

The rules will automatically display when you launch the game, but I'll also list the rules here:

- The name of the game is "Petals Around the Rose".
- The name of the game is important.
- A computer will calucate a result from five (5) dice rolls. You'll need to figure out how the computer is calculating the result.
- The result will always be an even number, or 0.
